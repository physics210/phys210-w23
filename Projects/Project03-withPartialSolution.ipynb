    "You have been transported back in time (again!) this time to Enrico Fermi's office at the University of Chicago in 1942. Fermi is hard at work trying to build the first self-sustaining artificial nuclear reaction using Uranium 235. Once he calms down from the shock of witnessing time travel, Fermi has asked for your help to explore how factors such as size, shape and purity impact the ability of a sample of Uranium 235 to sustain a chain reaction.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Fermi initially presents you with his simplest model to help make it easy to troubleshoot and confirm the results from the Monte Carlo simulation that you will build of this chain reaction process. In this model, when a $^{235}U$ nucleus undergoes nuclear fission, it always releases two thermal neutrons, where a thermal neutron is one that is moving slowly enough to possibly be captured by other $^{235}U$ nuclei. These thermal neutrons will travel an average distance, known as the Mean Free Path $λ$, before being captured elsewhere in the sample. The probability of a thermal neutron being captured when it travels a distance $L$ is given by $p(L)∝e^{-L/λ}$. In this model, every captured thermal neutron results in an unstable $^{235}U$ nucleus which will almost immediately undergo its own fission process, releasing further neutrons, and possibly sustaining a chain reaction if enough of the neutrons are being captured inside the $^{235}U$ sample. You and Fermi have decided that a Monte Carlo process would be the best way to simulate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your algorithm will look something like this:\n",
    "1. Choose an initial number of thermal neutrons, $N$, to simulate.\n",
    "2. Randomly generate $N$ starting locations within the Uranium for these initial thermal neutrons.\n",
    "3. Randomly generate the directions of travel, in three dimensions, of the $N$ initial thermal neutrons.\n",
    "4. Using the Mean Free Path, generate the distances, $L$, that the $N$ initial thermal neutrons will travel in the sample before being captured.\n",
    "5. Determine how many of the neutrons are absorbed inside the sample after they have each traveled their randomly determined distance $L$ in their randomly determined direction from their randomly determined initial position. Neutrons that are still inside the sample after traveling their distance $L$ are considered to have been captured and will initiate a new fission event. Neutrons that do not remain inside the sample after traveling their distance $L$ are lost and will not initiate any further fission events.\n",
    "6. Determine the number of new thermal neutrons generated, knowing that each of the new fission events will generate 2 new neutrons. We will call this total number of new thermal neutrons $N_{\\text{new}}$.\n",
    "7. Report the multiplication factor, $f=N_{\\text{new}}/N$, for that simulation. If this value is above 1, the number of thermal neutrons being generated is increasing, which will result in a sustained nuclear chain reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some initial brainstorming with Fermi results in the starter code below to generate $N$ initial thermal neutrons inside a cube with sides of length $a$. You will first spend some time characterizing uncertainties in the system, developing an understanding of how choices such as the initial number of thermal neutrons $N$ and the number of trials $m_\\text{trials}$ impacts these uncertainties. Then you will perform an investigation of how different parameters in the system, such as size, shape and purity, impact the system's ability to sustain a chain reaction (as determined by the multiplication factor).

    "Fermi's main task for you is to explore how the Multiplication Factor varies as a function of the shape and size of the sample, its purity, and the use of neutron moderators. You should start by coming up with research question(s) that explore(s) the behavior of $f$ over the phase space of this system. You should then make a visualization that effectively shows your answer to that question. Your visualizations should include fits that quantitatively capture the relationship between $f$ and your parameter(s) of choice. If you choose to implement any physical extensions, it would be good for your visualizations to include some exploration or demonstration of what their effects are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some parameters that you could vary as well as places to extend the physics of the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Shapes and aspect ratios:** The shape of the sample, which could include fundamentally different shapes, such as spheres, cylinders, and rectangular prisms (boxes). A helpful way to characterize the relative dimensions of a given shape (other than spheres and cubes) is the Shape Aspect Ratio, $S$. For a rectangular prism with volume $a \\times a \\times b$, the Shape Aspect Ratio would be $S=a/b$. For a cylinder it would be $S=r/h$. Compare how different shapes and/or different Shape Aspect Ratios impact $f$.\n",
    "* **Volume:** The volume of the sample, $V$.\n",
    "* **Probability that captured neutrons initiate further fissions:** The purity of the Uranium, where the more pure the sample, the more likely it is that a thermal neutron stopping inside the sample will be captured by a $^{235}U$ nucleus and result in a subsequent fission. In Fermi's simplest model, we treated it as $p=1.0$ that a neutron stopping within the sample would cause a subsequent fission, but you can explore the impact of varying the purity of the sample via this parameter.\n",
    "* **Mean free path:** Varying the mean free path in the sample via neutron moderators. When a thermal neutron interacts with a neutron moderator, it loses some kinetic energy, but has a negligible probability of actually being captured by the neutron moderator. In our simulation this can be modeled as reducing the mean free path of the neutrons in the sample since lower kinetic energies will mean that the neutrons travel less far before being absorbed.\n",
    "* **Number of neutrons per fission:** Although we used two neutrons per fission in Fermi's simplest model, the average number of neutrons produced per $^{235}U$ fission is actually 2.4355.\n",
    "* **Even more physics, coding and investigation extensions:** There is a lot of room to extend this project, which is a huge simplification of a nuclear chain reaction. One could account for the fact that more than one thermal neutron would have been generated at each location when generating our initial batch of thermal neutrons, could consider surrounding the sample with nuclear reflectors, could simulate multiple generations of fission events, could vary parameters such as $N_\\text{thermal}$ and $m_\\text{trials}$ in your phase space to do careful characterizations of uncertainty, and more.\n"
