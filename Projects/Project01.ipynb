    "# Instructions:\n",
    "This mini project is designed to prepare you for Projects 02-04 by reducing some of the communication expectations with respect to the later project. Below, you are given incomplete code that, when complete, should simulate what happens when two objects (balls) collide with each other and with barriers on either side. You have five tasks for this mini project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Task 1:** Update the starter code so that the collision between the two obejcts is handled correctly.\n",
    "* **Task 2:** Extend the physics of the simulation by introducing at least one additional challenging or interesting piece of physics (see below for some examples).\n",
    "* **Task 3:** Develop a multi-subplot graph that provides insight into the behaviour of your simulation. At least one of these subplots should be a new or novel visualization that we have not yet seen in the course, which provides further insight into the behaviour of your simulation.\n",
    "* **Task 4:** Choose two different sets of starting parameters and peform some calcualtions by hand to confirm that your simulation is behaving correctly. You can focus on the first collision with these calculations.\n",
    "* **Task 5:** Perform a series of self-assessments and reflections regarding how thoroughly you completed each task and how much you extended yourself when completing this mini-project.\n",
    "\n",
    "As outlined in the course's [overview of project assessment](https://physics210.github.io/phys210-w23/project_assessment.html), your project grade will be built from the following:\n",
    "1. The points awarded on the project assessment scale during your self-assessment, as updated by the grader.\n",
    "1. The grader's assessment of the accuracy of your self-assessments and the thoroughness of your reflections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of interesting of challenging physics you could include in your simulation:\n",
    "* Incorporating an adjustable coefficient of restitution.\n",
    "* Incorporating rolling or other relevant types of friction.\n",
    "* Incorporating other external forces or energy by having the objects be two pendula, two objects on an inclined plane, etc.\n",
    "* Turning it into a two-dimensional collision.\n"
