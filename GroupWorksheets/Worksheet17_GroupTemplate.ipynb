    "1. Start with a square 21 x 21 grid.\n",
    "1. A particle starts in the middle of the grid and undergoes a two-dimensional random walk like what we encountered in the reading assignment. It continues to random walk from square to square on the grid until it touches the edge of the grid, at which point it sticks to the edge, becoming permanently anchored there.\n",
    "1. A second particle starts at the center and does the same thing, but this time it stops and becomes permanently anchored if it touches the edge of the grid or the other particle.\n",
    "1. Each subsequent particle will do the same thing, stopping when it touches the edge or a previously anchored particle.\n",
    "1. Choose 100 as your maximum number of particles, but your program should also stop once a particle becomes permanently anchored to the middle location of the grid, preventing any further particles from entering the system.\n",
