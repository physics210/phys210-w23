Please attend the section in which you are registered. The division on the timetable between the Lecture and Lab portions of the course is primarily for bookkeeping. See class format, below.

**Pre-reqs:** One of PHYS 102, PHYS 108, PHYS 118, PHYS 158, PHYS 153, SCIE 001.

**Co-reqs:** One of MATH 152, MATH 221, MATH 223

**Office Hours:**	TBD

**Textbook:** There is no required textbook. Pre-reading notes will be provided. There are plenty of resources on the internet, but it is not always easy to locate what’s relevant and useful. There is a book available that uses a similar approach and is recommended if you want another source: A Student’s Guide to Python for Physical Modeling by Kinder and Nelson. There are three versions: “the original”, an “Updated Edition” and the latest “Second Edition.” The newest (2nd edition) is probably the best choice. An excellent free textbook is [Computational Physics with Python](https://freecomputerbooks.com/Computational-Physics-with-Python-by-Eric-Ayars.html) by Eric Ayars. 

**Online Tools:**

- **UBC Jupyter Open:** Course materials will be distributed primarily through UBC Jupyter Open (https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca/), which is the same computing environment currently being used in PHYS 119. 
- **Collaborative group-work on CoCalc:** A good portion of in-class time will be spent doing collaborative group-work in realtime collaborative Jupyter notebooks on CoCalc, which is Sagemath's online computing platform. Free accounts on this platform provide full access to what is needed for this group-work with somewhat limited computing resources. To set up an account at on https://cocalc.com/ you will need to use an email address. Please see the additional note below regarding your private information and CoCalc. 
- **Canvas:** We will make some use of Canvas for course announcements, limited distribution of materials, coursework submission and quizzes. Importantly, all course deadlines will be communicated via assignment and quiz due dates on Canvas.
- **iClickerCloud:** In-class polling.
- **Piazza:** Online discussion forums.

**Your private information and CoCalc:** CoCalc runs on servers outside of Canada, where UBC cannot guarantee the security of your private information. Please exercise caution regarding the use of your personal information in this context. You may wish to use a pseudonym and/or an email not associated with your UBC student profile when you create your CoCalc account. Please contact us at UBC (LT.hub@ubc.ca) or CoCalc's support team (help@sagemath.com) if you have any questions about your privacy. 

## CLASS FORMAT

The course will be split into four modules, each of which will culminate in a project. In each module there will be an initial series of lesson days and then two project days, where the first project day will also typically be used to administer a module quiz.

### Lesson days

During lesson days, the class period (lecture + lab) will start with a brief interactive lecture consisting of a review of the most common challenges (shared by you) from the pre-class reading assignment and then moving into some interactive polling questions. The remainder of the class period will be dedicated to small-group activities ("group worksheets"), with some additional time provided to gain additional practice on "solo worksheets", which will be due before the next class period for participation credit. 

### Project days

Each of the four modules will culminate in a small project, where you will use your computational physics skills to perform an investigation and communicate your findings. You will typically have one week to complete a project, with class time being dedicated to project work and a module quiz based on the content from that module. The lesson days leading up to the project will build up the computational (and sometimes physics) skills necessary to complete the project. 

### Quizzes

We will provide further details related to the format of the quizzes as we approach the date of the first quiz.

## GRADING SCHEME

Part A: 75%

* Pre-class reading assignment (~15, participation): 5%
* Group worksheets (~15, participation): 5%
* Solo worksheets (~15, participation): 5%
* Group quizzes (4): 5%
* Homework assignments (4, graded): 20%
* Projects (4, graded): 35%

Part B: 25%

* Solo quizzes (4): 25%.

Notes:

* You must pass both part A and part B to pass the course. If you receive a score below 50% on one part, the weighting of the other part will drop to 0, resulting in a failing grade.

Grading scheme and deadline flexibility

* iClicker polling questions will not count for marks.
* Pre-class reading assignments and solo worksheets will be graded for completion automatically by Canvas. We will routinely spot check this work and may ask you to resubmit work that is insufficiently complete or thorough.
* Group worksheets will be assessed via in-class checkpoint questions from the teaching team. Each person in the group will be asked a different question and will be provided as many chances as needed to give a correct or complete answer. We will drop your three lowest scores for these group worksheets. If you are absent from an in-person class, you will have the opportunity to use office hours to earn credit for answering relevant checkpoint questions for up to three group worksheets.
* We will drop your lowest solo quiz score and your lowest group quiz score. In the rare situation where you score higher on the solo quiz than on the group quiz, we will replace your group quiz score with your solo quiz score. Additionally, on the last day of class you will have the opportunity to sit the alternate version of one of the quizzes and keep the higher of the original or new mark for that quiz. 
* For course content other than quizzes, you can request one-week extensions for up to 20% of that type of coursework (projects, homework assignments, worksheets, etc) without needing to provide documentation or needing to apply for academic concessions. The extension request form can be found on Canvas. 
* For course content other than quizzes, you can revise and resubmit for up to 20% of that type of coursework. Your score for that item will be the average of the original and resubmitted scores. Resbmission will be submitted through Canvas. 
* For academic concessions beyond any of situations described above, appropriate documentation or correspondence from an advisor will be required. Please note that academic concessions may be granted for events falling under the categories of conflicting responsibilities, medical circumstances, or those that require compassionate grounds. Please see the UBC calendar entry on Academic Concession for further details.

If you do miss a class:

* Consult the appropriate resources on Canvas and Open Jupyter. Lecture slides and any additional notes will be posted to Canvas.
* Attend office hours, which will always have the option to attend remotely via Zoom. 
* Engage with the teaching team and your peers on Piazza

## COMMUNICABLE DISEASE SAFETY IN THE CLASSROOM

If you are sick, please stay home so that you can rest and recover, and to prevent others from getting sick. The grading and deadline policies in this course are flexible enough to allow you to easily miss a handful of days in the course without any penalty to your course grade.

## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND COLLABORATION

The academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is *your* work. Incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero for that work and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is deemed as needing to be referred to the Dean's office, where careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences. A more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in theAcademic Calendar at
http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.

### Policies regarding ChatGPT and other Generative AI

In this course we seek to embrace and teach the responsible use of ChatGPT and other forms of generative AI. These are extremely valuable tools in the toolkits of those engaging in computation, whether as students or practicing professionals. We will spend time in this course prompting these tools and learning to test and debug the code they provide. However, unless otherwise stated, it is expected that you provide appropriate attribution for any code you submit that was produced by generative AI, no matter how much you subsequently modify it. 

### Additional policies for PHYS 210

In the broadest terms, we expect that all work you submit represents something where you have made significant intellectual contributions and where that work ultimately reflects your understanding of the material. In the specific case of code or written work produced by generative AI, we consider you to have made a significant intellectual contribution when your interactions with the generative AI and its output required application of the skills and knowledge being developed in this course. An example of this would be extended back and forth interactions where you were assessing the generated code and refining your prompts to converge on code that worked as intended. Another example would be your own thorough and documented testing of the code generated from a prompt. We will never assign work to you with the intention that it could be completed by finding a resource with an already complete solution or by providing generative AI with a simple prompt. It is always better to check with us if you are unsure about your level of intellectual contribution in something you intend to submit rather than to later find yourself engaged in academic misconduct procedures.

* **Attribution:** As long as you are providing attribution, it is perfectly reasonable to use SMALL chunks of code provided by a peer or internet resource. In the case of generative AI, you may use and provide attribution for larger chunks of code as long as you are adhering to the expectation that you made significant intellectual contributions as outlined above.
* **Formal group work:** You are encouraged to talk to each other, to the teaching team, and to learn from any and all resources as your disposal. For in-class group activities, we expect you to fully participate in your group's collaborative activities and it is your responsibility to ensure you understand your group's work fully. 
* **Individual work:** It is not acceptable to gather with a friend or two to work through a project or homework assignment to produce a common version nor is it acceptable to submit a modified version of somebody else's work as your own.
* **Solo quizzes:** For the solo portion of the in-class quizzes, all work is strictly individual. You must not communicate with anybody else during the solo portion of in-class quizzes.
* **Group quizzes:** For the group portion of the in-class quizzes, communication is restricted to within your group.

## UNIVERSITY SUPPORT AND RESOURCES

UBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious and cultural observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions. Details of the policies and how to access support are available: https://senate.ubc.ca/policies-resources-support-student-success
