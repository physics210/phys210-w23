# Grading and self-assessment of Physics 210 projects
**Last update:** Sept 26, 2023

## *1.1* Overview of grading and self-assessment of projects

### 1.1.1 Framing the grading categories as peer-review editorial decisions
The Physics 210 projects consist of computational physics investigations and communication of those investigations. We seek to bring into your project process two very important aspects of the process of publishing a peer-reviewed manuscript (journal article).

* **Self-assessment:** When you submit a manuscript to be considered for publication in a journal, you must pay careful attention to the expectations established by the journal, such as the type of work it publishes as well as its content and formatting guidelines. As such, you must engage in careful self-assessment to judge when your ongoing revisions process has elevated the quality of your investigation and communication to the point that you are ready to submit your manuscript to the journal. 
* **Editorial and peer-review decisions:** Once it has been submitted and the editor has received the peer reviews from the referees, they will provide you with an editorial decision providing detailed feedback on how to improve the work and indicating the next steps toward publication for your manuscript. The exact names of these decisions may vary by journal, but the most common decisions are:<sup>1,2</sup>

**Editorial decision categories for peer-reviewed manuscripts**
| Editorial decision | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Accept for publication |Accepted for publication in its current form. This is relatively rare on the first submission, as most articles require at least some minor revisions before they are accepted. |
| Accept with minor revisions | It needs to undergo minor edits and alterations before it will be published |
| Major revisions | The journal is interested in publishing it once some structural issues are addressed and rectified. The revised paper will need to be peer-reviewed again. |
| Revise and Resubmit | The journal rejects the paper in its current form. However, the journal editors see potential in the paper and encourage a resubmission.
Reject  | The reviewers and/or the editor feel that there is poor alignment between the journal and the submitted manuscript. |

Additionally, outstanding manuscripts will often receive a “notable” distinction or be featured as a “highlighted paper” due to a combination of their originality, their potential impact on the field and the quality-level of the communication.

### 1.1.2 Assessment criteria and levels for Physics 210 projects

The Physics 210 project assessment categories will vary somewhat between Project 1 and the other projects, but here is an example set from Project 02:

| Assessment category examples for Project 02 |
| :--- |
| Sophistication and Extension of Physics and Coding Approaches |
| Thoroughness of Investigation |
| Communication of Physics and Co ding Approaches |
| Presentation of Results and Interpretation of Results |

The table below details how we adapt the editorial decision scale for Physics 210 projects, which will be applied to each of the assessment categories. We also provide descriptions and some other benchmarks for reference.

**Physics 210 project assessment scale, applied per assessment category**
| Decision scale | Letter-grade quality equivalent | Points awareded | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Outstanding | A+ | 10/10 | The work demonstrates initiative, insight and/or quality-level that goes above and beyond expectations. |
| Publish | A | 9/10 | The criteria have been fully addressed. There are no outstanding errors or issues. |
| Minor Revisions | B | 7/10 | There are minor errors or issues. The author can easily determine for themselves if the revisions are sufficient. |
| Major Revisions | C | 5/10 | There are major errors or issues requiring time and effort to address. The author should seek feedback to determine if the revisions are sufficient. |
| Rework | D | 3/10 | The work addresses only a minority of the criteria or is not well-aligned with the criteria. The author should seek further feedback before engaging in revisions. |
| Absent | Absent | 0/10 | The work addresses little to none of the criteria. |

### 1.13 Self-assessment

Finally, to help you develop your ability to compare your work against stated criteria and expectations, and to know when your work is ready to “submit for publication”, you will include a self-assessment of your project work when you submit it. This self-assessment will include you assigning an editorial decision to each of the assessment categories and writing a brief statement to justify the decision you applied. When grading, we will look at each category and consider the decision-level you applied and its justification. We will then leave it as is (“well-assessed”) or bump the decisions-level up or down while additionally providing feedback as to where we think your self-assessment could be improved. Finally, we add an additional assessment categoriy of “Accuracy of Self-Assessments and Thoroughness of Reflections" and then combine it with the revised decision levels to determine your overall project grade.
