Many questions have purposeful errors in the distributed version so make sure you have fixed them all such that \"Restart & Run All\" will run through the whole book and successfully print \"The notebook ran without errors\" at the end. If you have any trouble resolving the errors, please ask one of your classmates or ask us in class or on Piazza.\n",
