    "* We are always excited for you to learn new techniques, approaches, libraries and functions on your own, but keep in mind that this coding task *can* be completed using only the python tools we have learned so far in this course. The quiz on Sept 27 will consist primarily of tasks based on the code you build here and extensions to this code, so please make sure that you have a very good understanding of how all aspects of your code work, whether you are using existing existing tools from the course or learning new ones beyond what we have covered so far.\n",
    "* If you are already familiar with numpy arrays or defining your own functions, try to complete this coding task without using these tools. You will not lose marks for using these tools, but we encourage you to take on the slightly more challenging task of not using these tools.\n",
    "* You should be producing a single two-subplot graph, as opposed to two individual plots. To get the size correct, you can use one of the following, based on if you are using `plt.subplots()` or `plt.subplot()`: `fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1, figsize=(8, 12))` or `plt.figure(figsize=(8, 12))`\n",
    "* You do not need to reproduce the exact same grid shown (every 5 m/s and every 5 s), but you should add a grid using `plt.grid(True)` or `ax[0].grid(True)`, as appropriate.\n",
    "* The graph titles should be produced using one of the three string formatting techniques and using a variable `time_A` for when the police car first had a higher speed than the speeding car and a variable `time_B` for when the police car first passed (had a larger position) the speeding car. The numbers for these two times should never be input into the titles manually nor should they be assigned to these variables manually. Instead, you should extract these in such a way that these values would still be found correctly by your code if you changed a parameter in the program such as the speeding car's speed or the police car's acceleration."
