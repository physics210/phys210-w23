    "For this task, we are giving you a dataset showing the propagation of a sin wave over time, `SoloDay19-Data.txt`. Your task is to animate this dataset using either `Artistanimation` or `FuncAnimation`, and then use this animation to determine when the direction of the wave changes. The dataset is structured with 3 columns: `t`, `x` and `y`.\n",

Many questions have purposeful errors in the distributed version so make sure you have fixed them all such that \"Restart & Run All\" will run through the whole book and successfully print \"The notebook ran without errors\" at the end. If you have any trouble resolving the errors, please ask one of your classmates or ask us in class or on Piazza.\n",
