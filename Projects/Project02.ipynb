    "# Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been transported back in time to the office of Hantaro Nagaoka at Tokyo Univeristy in 1904 shortly after the discovery of the electron, but before the development of quantum mechanics.  Thankfully your computer, with python installed, made the trip with you. Hantaro is working on his \"Saturnian\" model for the structure of the atom. In this model, electrons orbit a positively charged center similar to the rings of saturn. You've offered to use python to help him work on his theory.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Lucky for you and for Hantaro, you were learning how to work with `solve_ivp` to play electric field hockey in Physics 210 before you were transported back in time. The code you made for that and for Homework 02 serve as great starting points for exploring the Saturnian model!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to explore sets of parameters that support stable electron orbits. Your project must include a minimum of three particles, e.g., at least one electron and two charged nuclei or at least one charged nucleus and two electrons. Don't limit yourself to configurations that look strictly like an electron orbiting a compact nucleus. You can explore molecular-style orbitals within this \"Saturnian\" model or let your imagination take you to even more surprising configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "After some initial explorations to find a configuration of charges that you would find interesting to investigate, you should develop a research question based on exploring the phase space of your system. By this we mean that your investigation should consist of looking at orbital stability in response to systematic variation of one or more of the initial conditions in your system. How does orbital stability depend on the initial velocity or velocities of your orbiting charge(s) or the initial positions of your nuclei or orbiting charge(s)? Or are there other parameters in your system that you might investigate?\n",
    "\n",
    "To communicate the results of your investigation you should develop a set of visualizations that communicate the critical results you will use to answer to your research question. It is likely that you will need multiple panels (subplots) to effectively communicate your these results, but try to keep your visualizations limited to one overall figure. The intention is for you to make a static figure that could be included in a report, not to make animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Hint:* Like you did with your Homework 02 code code, it will be much easier to see how your system responds to changing initial conditions if you make a function that returns useful information about the properities of the oribit(s) in response to providing this function a set of initial conditions.
