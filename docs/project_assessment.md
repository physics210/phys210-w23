# Grading and self-assessment of Physics 210 projects
**Last update:** Sept 26, 2023

## *1.1* Overview of grading and self-assessment of projects

### 1.1.1 Framing the grading categories as peer-review editorial decisions
The Physics 210 projects consist of computational physics investigations and communication of those investigations. We seek to bring into your project process two very important aspects of the process of publishing a peer-reviewed manuscript (journal article).

* **Self-assessment:** When you submit a manuscript to be considered for publication in a journal, you must pay careful attention to the expectations established by the journal, such as the type of work it publishes as well as its content and formatting guidelines. As such, you must engage in careful self-assessment to judge when your ongoing revisions process has elevated the quality of your investigation and communication to the point that you are ready to submit your manuscript to the journal. 
* **Editorial and peer-review decisions:** Once it has been submitted and the editor has received the peer reviews from the referees, they will provide you with an editorial decision providing detailed feedback on how to improve the work and indicating the next steps toward publication for your manuscript. The exact names of these decisions may vary by journal, but the most common decisions are:1,2

| Title | Title |
| :--- | :--- |
| Accept for publication |Accepted for publication in its current form. This is relatively rare on the first submission, as most articles require at least some minor revisions before they are accepted. |
| Accept with minor revisions | It needs to undergo minor edits and alterations before it will be published |
| Major revisions | The journal is interested in publishing it once some structural issues are addressed and rectified. The revised paper will need to be peer-reviewed again. |
| Revise and Resubmit | The journal rejects the paper in its current form. However, the journal editors see potential in the paper and encourage a resubmission.
Reject  |
| The reviewers and/or the editor feel that there is poor alignment between the journal and the submitted manuscript. |
