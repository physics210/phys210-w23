    "1. Predict the output from combining two numerical numpy arrays of the same shape using the common arithmetic operations `+`, `-`, `/`, and `*`.\n",
    "1. Define (create) an array with one or more dimensions and fill it with values provided via a list (e.g., `numpy.array([1, 2, 3])`).\n",
    "1. Use an intrinsic array creation function to define an array and fill it with zeros or ones (e.g., `numpy.zeros(3)`).\n",

NumPy also provides many types, for example bool, int8, int16, int32, int64, float16, float32, float64, float128, complex64, complex128.

Larger numbers indicate that larger values that can be stored in the data type, and for floats, with higher precision.\n",
